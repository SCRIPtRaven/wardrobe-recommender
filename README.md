./gradlew lintDebug
```

- Reference screenshots: `app/src/test/screenshots/`
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `assembleDebug verifyRoborazziDebug lintDebug` on every push to `main` and on pull requests.

## Code

```
app/src/main/java/app/wardrobe/
  AppContainer.kt         shared objects: repository, recognizer, forecast, theme
  data/                   repository, sample data, stand-in recognizer
  domain/model/           items, colors, forecast
  feature/wardrobe/       grid and filters
  feature/item/           detail, add, edit
  feature/outfits/        generator, results, sample outfits
  feature/settings/       settings
  navigation/             routes, back stacks per tab, app shell
  ui/                     theme, shared components, labels
tools/
  theme_palette.py        generates ui/theme/Color.kt, checks WCAG AA contrast
  install_icon.py         imports a Material Symbols icon into res/drawable
```

Screens with data: a ViewModel exposing one `StateFlow` of UI state, and a stateless `...Content` composable that the screenshot tests render. Settings reads the theme from `AppContainer`.
